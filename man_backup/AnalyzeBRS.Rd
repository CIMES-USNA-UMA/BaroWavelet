\title{Analyze baroreflex sensitivity}
\usage{
AnalyzeBRS(framework, locator, method = c("both", "dwt", "cwt"))
}
\arguments{
\item{framework}{An analysis environment generated by \link[WaveletPhysiology]{BuildStructure}}

\item{locator}{An locator indicating which analysis slot needs to be used}

\item{method}{Which method to be used to estimate the transfer function. Default is both.}
}
\value{
The original analysis environment, in which baroreflex sensitivity has been estimated
        from the chosen data
}
\description{
Computes the baroreflex sensitivity from data located in an analysis environment.
}
\examples{
Data <- InterpolateData(DataSimulation(), f = 1)
Study <- BuildStructure()
Study <- AddAnalysis(Study, name = "Simulation")
Study <- AddDataToAnalysis(Study, 1, Data$RR, Data$SBP, Data$Time)
Study <- AnalyzeBRS(Study, 1)
